synopsis:       Reduced instruction set i386 simulator
description:
  risc386 is a symbolic Intel(R) 386 assembler interpreter which
  allows infinitely many registers (temporaries).  Its purpose is
  to debug the output of a MiniJava compiler (from Andrew Appel's
  book, Modern Compiler Implementation in JAVA) before register
  allocation has been performed.
  .
  risc386 supports only a small fragment of i386 instructions.
  It expects its input to be a list of procedures in .intel_syntax
  each of which is started by a label and terminated by a return
  statement.
  .
  Control flow is restricted, so, only jumps to procedure-local
  labels are allowed.  Reading from an uninitialized memory location
  will lead to an exception.
